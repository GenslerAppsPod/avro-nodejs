#Avro-Nodejs

A wrapper for the c++ implemenation of Avro.

#The Why

  Javascript is a async callback world so the avro library should play in that world. I've also seen far too many partially completed avro javascript projects on github. 

#API

###Avro sync

  avro.encodeDatum(schema, value);

  avro.decodeDatum(schema, Buffer);

#####Example

    var avro = new addon.Avro();
    var bytes = avro.encodeDatum('"float"', 12345.89);
    avro.decodeDatum('"float"', new Buffer(bytes));

###Avro async

  avro.queueSchema(schema, onSuccess, onError);

  avro.push(Buffer);

  Currently there is only async support for decoding avro. 
  The implementation is designed for the ability to queue multiple avro schemas to be
  decoded with queueSchema(). The push() function pushes bytes to the stream being parsed in a none blocking manor.
  On the completion the call backs are called. 

#####Example

    var avro = new addon.Avro();
    avro.queueSchema('{"type": "map", "values": "bytes"',
      function(datum){
        console.log("datum: ", datum);
      },
      function(error){
        console.log(error);
      });

    avro.push(message.binarydata);//message as defined by some stream or websocket. 

#Build and run

	
Install and build the avro c++ project found.
<https://github.com/apache/avro>

Then setup the needed paths in the binding.gyp file. After that we can build avro-nodejs.

    node-gyp configure build

    node server.js
